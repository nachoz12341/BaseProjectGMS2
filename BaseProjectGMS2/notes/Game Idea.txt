Game idea:
collectathon
not quite a twin stick shooter as it uses a harpoon
limited shots
harpoon shot collects items/ same with grapling hook
can expire/ need to collect more shots
small focused levels
need to not 100% to progress (oof)


fish themed?
two legged fish
collect shells to pay for upgrades?
something like this I guess


special unlock ideas:
grapling hook upgrade - brings enemies to you, brings you to terrain(only certain types of terrain)?
headbutt - what you follow up with after grapling enemy
more harpoons - increased shots
explosive harpoons - explodes after contact
